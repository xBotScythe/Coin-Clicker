# Coin-Clicker
A python-based coin clicker I made for APCSP my junior year. Yet I still somehow got a 3 because my name was in the terminal (or because I used an external library, I genuinely don't know but it was literally impossible to bomb the multiple choice).

Obligatory I hate College Board :)
